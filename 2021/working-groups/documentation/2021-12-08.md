## 2021-12-08

### Last week's action items

- [x] [name=Justin] Cancel last 2 weeks of Dec and first week of Jan
- [x] [name=Chi-Li] put some open issues onto the project management board
- [ ] [name=Melissa] write doc on running local preview workflow


### Agenda

- [name=Melissa] TOC reorganization
  - There are some [problems with the build workflow](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3751#issuecomment-988191020). This is a blocker, we need to ping Nick again.
- [name=Genevieve] ``.lycheeignore`` file for broken link checks not being respected [PR #294](https://github.com/napari/napari.github.io/pull/294). Gen is out of ideas now, anyone else know why it works [here](https://github.com/GenevieveBuckley/broken-link-checker) but not in napari? Blocking.
- [name=Nathan] Help Nathan
  - np2 manifest specification docs



### Next week's action items
------
- [ ] [name=Justin?] Follow up on Triage of content items
- [ ] [name=Nathan] Add a note to the "Creating a napari plugin page" to direct people to npe2 / warn them about a potential change in 2022.
- [ ] [name=Genevieve] ``.lycheeignore`` 
  - [ ] Suggestion from Draga: echoing the current working directly from inside the github workflow, just to check we are where we expect & .lycheeignore is in the right spot
  - Suggestion from Justin:
    - [ ] modifying the .lycheeignore file to ignore ALL the links (so we can see if it's finding the ignore file at all)
    - [ ] Perhaps there is some subtle syntax error with the ignore file? Modify the ignorefile to exclude only one specific link and then check to see if that happened correctly.

At the end of the meeting:
- Copy the contents of this document to a new file in https://github.com/napari/meeting-notes/new/main/2021/working-groups/documentation
- Clear out the Agenda from last meeting
