### Agenda

- [Andy]: proposal to use pandas DataFrame for properties
    - doc: https://hackmd.io/emsLO3cUR3O9nxSc6YYwUA
    - WIP PR: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3730
- [Andy]: how to store multiple measurements?
    - Some plugins like `napari-skimage-regionprops` measure values from an image layer in regions defined by a labels layer, then store the result in `Labels.properties`.
    - This overwrites any existing properties.
    - To support measuring multiple image layers with the same labels layer, we need to augment the index/key of features/properties.
    - Should we store measurements somewhere else?
    

### Action items
