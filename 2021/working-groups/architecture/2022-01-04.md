## 2022/01/04

### Agenda

- Andy: deprecation plan for properties
- Nathan: transforms
    - discussion around named dimensions: https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3848
    - lots of good ideas, but probably need a bit more cohesion
- Ahmet Can: async
    - ideally use python's built-in concurrent package (i.e. Futures and Executors)


### Action items

- Andy: ask community for timeline of properties and next minor version release (i.e. napari 0.5)
- Andy/Nathan: invite alister/kevin to talk through transform requirements for their work in next arch WG meeting
