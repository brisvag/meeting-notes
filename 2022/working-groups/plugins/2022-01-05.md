- **Date:** 2022-01-05
- **Agenda**
    - [last meeting](https://hackmd.io/D6dWiLOAQ-uWNKvZUa7UDw)
    - Kevin - which plugin engine should we recommend for the hackathon on Jan 18
        - We should make it clear that npe2 is still being polished (i.e., users will have to separately install npe2, docs are being updated, bugs are being found/squashed), but they should use npe2 if possible
        - support for npe1 should be at least 6 months and the migration should be relatively painless (autoconvert tool is already working pretty well)
    - npe2 compatibility strategy
        - migration
    - autogenerated docs
- **Participants:**
