<!-- Discussion goes here-->
#### Schemas
- see pr [npe2#83]
- See: schemastore.org
- options
    - could have version on schema store always be the current version, last release
- how to keep schemastore pointing at the right file
- desirables:
    1. it would be nice if schemastore link is permanent (i.e. schema.json)... but it's possible to update link on schemastore if need be
    2. when you check out a tag in the repo, the schema.json should reflect the state of schema on that tag
    3. schema store should always be pointing to a schema reflecting the latest version on PyPI, not the dev version.
       - (this may the same if SCHEMA_VERSION hasn't changed)
    
Possible approach:
- on deploy action
    - github adds tag "stable_schema" and pushes the tag
    - add check: that schema.json and dev.json match in SCHEMA_VERSION.

- use a link to a release


### multiple-entry point handling

proposal: npe2 does discovery, passes npe1 entry points to the npe1 manager
