### Agenda

- Andy: group sync
    - What are we working on now, what's next.
- Andy: more organization around transforms/slicing/async work?
    - Goals for 2022, H1, Q1. How do we get there?
    - H1
        - Understanding what napari (inc. vispy) does now with respect to goals right now
            - To be able to split up the work
            - Also to understand what behaviors we need to continue to support
            - Split up topics, collect technical design issues/bugs
                - Image + Points
                - Data loading
                    - Eric
                    - from array-like + dims -> vispy
                    - what can we pass to vispy
                    - things like _data _data_raw
                - Transforms
                    - Andy
                    - who stores these, how to they get used, how are they consumed by vispy
                - Dims
                    - Greg
                - Nathan will oversee and help out as needed
        - Async data loading, detach napari sliders from sync data loading.
            - Eric initially leads
            - Decouple async from tile loading (i.e. this is not about tiles)
            - To improve non-responsive UI
            - Have the right design for updating the vispy model
            - Focusing on image layers initially, but taking into account all types
            - Fork napari, some subset of behavior as philip's octree, but using Futures package.
        - Separate dims/slicing and layers
            - Greg initially leads
            - Understand where Dims + data collide
            - Pull out dims state from at least image layer
            - Dims.events are particularly important to think about
            - Possibly a dims-like instance per layer
            - Some early related work: https://github.com/perlman/napari/commits/jni_async_slice
        - Tiling + transforms likely go together, but prob later.
        
### Action items

- Andy, Greg, Eric, Nathan: write notes on current design/understanding
